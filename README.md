This lab replicates a real IT Help Desk environment.  
I used Jira Service Management to handle simulated support tickets covering common IT issues such as VPN login failures, password resets, and software troubleshooting.

## 🎯 Skills Demonstrated
- Ticket creation, assignment, and workflow management
- User communication and triage
- Troubleshooting Windows, VPN, and network access issues
- Documentation and root cause analysis

## 📁 Project Structure
- `/tickets` → Full ticket PDFs and resolutions  
- `/screenshots` → Proof of work from Jira  
- `/troubleshooting-checklist.md` → Commands and steps  
- `/lessons-learned.md` → What I improved after each case  

## 🧠 Tools Used
Jira Service Management • Windows 11 • Cisco AnyConnect • Documentation best practices
