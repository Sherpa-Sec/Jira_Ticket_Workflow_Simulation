# 🧰 Help Desk Ticket Simulation (Jira Service Management)

This project replicates a real IT Help Desk environment.  
I used Jira Service Management to work through common support issues like VPN failures, account lockouts, printer errors, Outlook problems, and phishing reports.

## 🎯 Skills Demonstrated
- Ticket creation, triage, assignment, and workflow tracking  
- Clear communication with users and internal notes  
- Troubleshooting Windows, VPN, Outlook, printer, and network access issues  
- Root cause analysis with step-by-step documentation  
- Following a real help desk lifecycle from report → diagnosis → fix → closure  

## 📁 Project Structure
- `/tickets` → Completed Jira tickets with screenshots and resolutions
- `README.md` → Project overview and documentation


## 🧠 Tools Used
- Jira Service Management
- Windows 11
