# 🧰 Help Desk Ticket Simulation ( Jira Service Management )

This project replicates a real IT Help Desk environment.  
I used Jira Service Management to simulate handling common IT support requests — including VPN login issues, password resets, and software troubleshooting.

## 🎯 Skills Demonstrated
- Ticket creation, assignment, and workflow tracking  
- Internal triage and customer communication  
- Troubleshooting Windows, VPN, and network access problems  
- Root cause analysis and clear documentation

## 📁 Project Structure
- `/tickets` → Completed Jira tickets and resolutions  
- *(More folders can be added later for screenshots, lessons learned, or troubleshooting guides.)*

## 🧠 Tools Used
Jira Service Management • Windows 11 • Cisco AnyConnect • Microsoft 365 • Documentation best practices
